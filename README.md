# List of Servers Project

### App deploy here [Server's site](https://manucho007.github.io/nordsec-servers/)

## Improvements list

If I had more time I would have liked to:

-   Add pagination to the list of servers
-   Add a search bar for the servers
-   Increase the code coverage
-   Add E2E testing with cypress
-   Improve the design of the store
-   fix the open navigation menu on mobile screen ;)
-   Add better error handling to the services
-   Add input validators to Login inputs
-   Reorganize the components.

-FYI I tried to use VITE but I couldn't sÂ´properly setup jest to run on any test for react files, so I had to go back to create-react-app.

## Tech Stack

-   React
